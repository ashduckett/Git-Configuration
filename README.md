# How to use

Get hold of the udacity-terminal-config directory from the repository. Next put the file named bash_profile into your home directory.

You can access your home directory by typing cd.
You can then open it using start .
Once the bash_profile is in there, rename it using

mv bash_profile .bash_profile

Next put a copy of this directory into your home directory.

Rename the directory so it has a dot at the start of its name using the same command as above.

Everything should be cushty.
